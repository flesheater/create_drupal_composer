# create_drupal_composer
A simple script that would create a drupal 8 website, using the Drupal 8 composer template https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project

You should have composer installed

You should have drush installed - on my local I am testing it with Drush 8

Also I have my Drupal environment set up according to this (https://echo.co/blog/os-x-1010-yosemite-local-development-environment-apache-php-and-mysql-homebrew) ,
which makes sence to have the script running in your Sites folder, and after running it - you will have a full, working
Drupal 8 website, with some good practices already implemented.

You just copy your create_drupal_comp.sh file to your Sites folder and run it without arguments.
It will then ask you for the name of the website.
